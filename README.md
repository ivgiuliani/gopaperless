An attempt at going paperless
=============================

This repository holds copies of notes I took on paper for some
classes. It's my attempt at going paperless with as many things as
possible and it's also a means to (digitally) backup all of these
things.

Some of these notes are in Italian, some in English and some in both
(I tend to use any language _I feel_ it fits better in that situation,
I can only imagine what will happen if I ever learn russian or japanese),
and it's very likely that they contain mistakes. However they include
things in which I put a lot of effort and I'd like to keep them safe
from any kind of accident.
